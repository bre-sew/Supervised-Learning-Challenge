# Supervised-Learning-Challenge
## Predicting Credit Risk
### Background
In this challenge, we are using LendingClub loan data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, we are comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
### Prediction
I have limited knowledge of loans or lending patterns, but I believe the logistic regression will perform better because we're working with a comprehensive training dataset.
### Initial Results
Counter to my prediction, the random forest classifier performed better than the logistic regression. However, neither model had a very good score.
- Logistic Regression
  - train score: 0.65
  - test score: 0.51
- Random Forest Classifier
  - train score: 1.0
  - test score: 0.63
### Scaled Results
After scaling the data, the logistic regression performed better than the random forest classifier, as I predicted. Scaling the results also improved each model's score.
- Logistic Regression
  - train score: 0.71
  - test score: 0.76
- Random Forest Classifier
  - train score: 1.0
  - test score: 0.64
